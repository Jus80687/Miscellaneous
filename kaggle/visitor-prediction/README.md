Instructions
====================================

# Running the code
Open an iPython session and run the code in `use-kalman.py` interactively.
Data from the contest recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting goes in the
`input` folder.

# Dependencies
I used Anaconda 2.7. I believe all libraries are included in that distribution.
